# Model results 6/12/24
## Brief summary
The L2/3 model is built with a similar structure to Ziao's M1 L5 model. However some key difference the connectivity and excitatory single cell template. There was an increase in the connectivity betweem PN2FSI,FSI2PN and LTS2PN connections based on L2/3 papers. The rest of the connection functions have not been altered however due to a difference in Exc2Inh cells in the network the same connection functions result in different convergence(tho not signicantly different in some cases). 

There is also only 1 excitatory cell template that was made to be more L2/3 like from matching single cell properties instead of the CP and CS cell found in the L5 model.
