    abstract = {We present a unique, extensive, and open synaptic physiology analysis platform and dataset. Through its application, we reveal principles that relate cell type to synaptic properties and intralaminar circuit organization in the mouse and human cortex. The dynamics of excitatory synapses align with the postsynaptic cell subclass, whereas inhibitory synapse dynamics partly align with presynaptic cell subclass but with considerable overlap. Synaptic properties are heterogeneous in most subclass-to-subclass connections. The two main axes of heterogeneity are strength and variability. Cell subclasses divide along the variability axis, whereas the strength axis accounts for substantial heterogeneity within the subclass. In the human cortex, excitatory-to-excitatory synaptic dynamics are distinct from those in the mouse cortex and vary with depth across layers 2 and 3. Insights into the organization and dynamics of local neocortical circuits are central to our understanding of brain processing. Neither macroscopic connectome analyses nor ultramicroscopic connectome studies provide such information. Using slice electrophysiology, Campagnola et al. collected a very large dataset to study the organization of cortical microcircuits in mice and humans. They analyzed the strength and probability of chemical and electrical connections; the latency and kinetic properties of synaptic responses; and cell classification features such as morphology, intrinsic physiology, transgenic markers, and cortical layer. The authors also modeled quantal release and short-term plasticity. Synaptic variability was a primary driver of cross-subclass differences. Compared with the connections in mice, human excitatory synapses had lower variability. —PRS The temporal dynamics of interneuronal connections and local connectivity are analyzed in mouse and human brain slices.}
